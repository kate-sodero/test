# Executing Programmed Movements - Robot Programming

In this part, we will load the poses we saved in the previous section and write a Python program to move the robot through these points. 

!!! warning "For all methods belonging to the `robot` object in this section, you **must explicitly specify the argument names** (keyword arguments). Positional arguments will not work."

**Goal:** Write a Python script to fetch saved poses, turn on the servo, avoid singularities, and execute precise linear and joint movements.

## Setup: Creating a New Motion File

<figure markdown="span">

    <figcaption>Clicking the Motion icon and + button</figcaption>
</figure>

1. Click the **Motion** icon on the left side of the screen.
2. Click the **+** button on the right side.
3. A new file named `untitled 1` will be created. This is where we will be writing our code from now on.
4. First, let's rename this file to `test_motion` and click save.

    ![save_test_motion](images/save_test_motion.png)
    <figcaption>Renaming the file to test_motion and saving</figcaption>
</figure>

## Step 1: Fetching and Verifying Pose Data

First, let's load the poses we saved earlier.

1. In the code editor, start typing `robot.get_pose` and the auto-complete list will appear.
2. Select or complete it to `robot.get_pose_bank_data`.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![autocomplete_get_pose](images/autocomplete_get_pose.png)
    <figcaption>Auto-complete suggestions for get_pose</figcaption>
</figure>

3. Write the following code:

```python
robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p1")
```

4. Click **Save** in the top right corner. The system will perform basic syntax checking and save your code. 

Wait! Before we execute the program, let's set this script as the Default Motion.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![set_default_motion](images/set_default_motion.png)
    <figcaption>Setting the script as the Default Motion</figcaption>
</figure>

5. Click the **Play** button to run the program. **Notice that nothing happens.**

<figure markdown="span">
    ![play_button](images/play_button.png)
    <figcaption>Clicking the Play button to execute the script</figcaption>
</figure>

This is because the function was called, but we didn't print its returned value. Let's use the `console` function to view it. Update your code to:

```python
robot.console(message=robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p1")[1][3])
robot.console(message=robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p2")[1][3])
robot.console(message=robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p3")[1][3])
robot.console(message=robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p4")[1][3])
```


Save and run. On the **Home** screen's **Console Output**, you will see the TCP pose data printed out:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![home_console_output](images/home_console_output.png)
    <figcaption>Viewing output in the Home screen's Console</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! info "The data we actually need is located at index `[1][3]` of the returned list. This is the raw TCP pose data."
---

## Step 2: Setting Up Target Variables

Now, let's assign these extracted poses to variables and define the velocity (`vel`) and acceleration (`acc`) for each movement.

```python
p1 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p1")[1][3]
p2 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p2")[1][3]
p3 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p3")[1][3]
p4 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p4")[1][3]

p1_target = {'pose': p1, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
p2_target = {'pose': p2, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
p3_target = {'pose': p3, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
p4_target = {'pose': p4, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
```

---

## Step 3: Servo Control and Avoiding Singularity

To move the robot via programming, we must turn the servo on, just like clicking the Servo On button in the Jog tab.

1. Type `robot.set_servo` and press `Tab` to auto-complete.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![autocomplete_set_servo](images/autocomplete_set_servo.png)
    <figcaption>Auto-complete for set_servo_on_off</figcaption>
</figure>

2. The auto-completed signature looks like `robot.set_servo_on_off(state: bool)`. Modify it as follows:

```python
robot.set_servo_on_off(state=True)
sleep(1) # Adds a small delay to ensure brakes are fully released
```



Next, to avoid the singularity position (fully stretched arm), we will do an initial joint movement to slightly bend Joint 2 (the elbow).

```python
home_q_target = {'q': [0, 1.57, 0, 0], 'vel': 0.3, 'acc': 0.3}

robot.move_joint(waypoints=[home_q_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)
```

---

## Step 4: Basic Linear Movements (Using Sleep)

Let's move the robot through the square using `move_linear`.

1. Type `robot.move_l` and press Enter to auto-complete `robot.move_linear`.
2. The signature will look like `robot.move_linear(waypoints: list, blocking: bool, finish_mode: typing.Literal['FINE', 'ROUGH'])`. 
3. Remove the extra arguments for now and use hardcoded delays (`sleep(3)`) to separate the movements.

### Intermediate Code:
```python
robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p1_target])
sleep(3)
robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p2_target])
sleep(3)
robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p3_target])
sleep(3)
robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p4_target])
sleep(3)
```

If you save and run this, the robot will move to `p1`, pause for 3 seconds, move to `p2`, pause for 3 seconds, and so on. However, using fixed `sleep()` timers is an unreliable workaround. A proper program needs to verify that the robot has actually reached its target.

---

## Step 5: Advanced Logic using check_finish()

To properly check if the robot has arrived, we use `robot.check_finish()`. 

If you auto-complete it, you get `robot.check_finish(finish_mode: typing.Literal['FINE', 'ROUGH'])`. Leaving it empty defaults to `finish_mode='FINE'`.
- **FINE mode:** Checks that the planned trajectory has finished *and* verifies that the actual joint encoder values are within a specific threshold of the target.

When the robot reaches the target, the boolean at index `[1]` becomes `True`.

### Updated Reliable Code:
Replace the `sleep(3)` lines with `while` loops that wait until the movement is finished:

```python
robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p1_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)

robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p2_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)

robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p3_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)

robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p4_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)
```
Save and run. The robot will now transition to the next target exactly when it arrives at the current one, without unnecessary delays.

---

## Step 6: Continuous Movement (Combining Waypoints)

Instead of sending distinct commands for each point, you can bundle them into a single command for a smooth, continuous trajectory.

### Final Refined Code:
```python
p1 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p1")[1][3]
p2 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p2")[1][3]
p3 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p3")[1][3]
p4 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p4")[1][3]

p1_target = {'pose': p1, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
p2_target = {'pose': p2, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
p3_target = {'pose': p3, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
p4_target = {'pose': p4, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}

home_q_target = {'q': [0, 1.57, 0, 0], 'vel': 0.3, 'acc': 0.3}

robot.set_servo_on_off(state=True)
sleep(1)

robot.move_joint(waypoints=[home_q_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)

robot.move_linear(waypoints=[p1_target, p2_target, p3_target, p4_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)
```

!!! idea "**Pro Tip:** When executing multiple waypoints in a single `move_linear` command, you may notice slight circular blending (arc interpolation) as the robot passes through the corners. If you want sharp, complete stops at every point instead, you can specify a `radius` of `0` in your target definitions."

---

## Step 7: Executing Joint Movements (Using move_joint)

In the previous steps, we used `move_linear` to move the TCP in a perfectly straight line between points. However, you can also move the robot by directly driving its specific joint angles to their saved states. This is done using the `move_joint` command.

When we fetched the Cartesian pose data earlier, we used index `[1][3]` (`[x, y, z, rx, ry, rz]`). To get the raw joint angles (`[q1, q2, q3, q4, ...]`), we simply change the index to `[1][4]`.

!!! info "**Concept:** While `move_linear` forces the tool tip to travel in a straight line, `move_joint` calculates the most efficient way for the individual motors to reach their target angles. This often results in a slightly curved, sweeping motion in 3D space, which is typically faster and smoother for the mechanical joints."

### Fetching Joint Data and Setting Targets

Let's extract the joint angles and set up new target dictionaries. Notice that we use the key `'q'` instead of `'pose'`:

```python
# Fetching raw joint angles (index [1][4]) instead of Cartesian poses
q1 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p1")[1][4]
q2 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p2")[1][4]
q3 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p3")[1][4]
q4 = robot.get_pose_bank_data(name="p4")[1][4]

# Defining the targets using the 'q' key
q1_target = {'q': q1, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
q2_target = {'q': q2, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
q3_target = {'q': q3, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
q4_target = {'q': q4, 'vel': 0.5, 'acc': 0.5}
```

### Executing the Sequence

Just like with `move_linear`, you can execute these targets sequentially and use `check_finish()` to ensure the robot has successfully reached each point before issuing the next command:

```python
robot.move_joint(waypoints=[q1_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)

robot.move_joint(waypoints=[q2_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)

robot.move_joint(waypoints=[q3_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)

robot.move_joint(waypoints=[q4_target])
while robot.check_finish()[1] is False:
    sleep(0.1)
```

!!! idea "**Pro Tip:** Exactly like our continuous linear movements, you can also bundle these joint targets into a single command for a smooth, uninterrupted trajectory: "
    `robot.move_joint(waypoints=[q1_target, q2_target, q3_target, q4_target])`
